            <p class="para">
              <span class="first-word">Imagine</span> a world where you can send
              money directly to someone without a bank in seconds instead of
              days, and you don’t pay exorbitant bank fees. Or one where you
              <strong
                >store money in an online wallet not tied to a bank, meaning you
                are your own bank and have complete control over your
                money</strong
              >. You don’t need a bank’s permission to access or move it, and
              never have to worry about a third party taking it away, or a
              government’s economic policy manipulating it. This is not a world
              of the future; it is a world that an avid but growing number of
              early adopters live in right now. And these are just a few of the
              important blockchain technology use cases that are transforming
              the way we trust and exchange value. We’ll get into the rest later
              on.
              <img src="./blockchain1.jpg" class="img3" alt="journey" />

              Yet, for many, blockchain technology is still a mysterious or even
              intimidating topic. Some even remain skeptical that we’ll use this
              technology in the future. 2021 is to blockchain what the late
              1990s were to the internet. And like the internet, blockchain
              technology is anything but a fad, it’s here to stay, and if you’re
              reading this, you’re early too.

              <!-- should my chat app look & work. So , first of
            all I am trying to figure out what type of functionality should I
            include & what UI/UX strategy should I develop or follow. So here I am
            requesting to my respectable fellow to give me honest feedback about my
            app that which feature of the app are awesome & which part of the app
            should I improve thank. -->

            <h2>Blockchain For Beginners</h2>
            <p class="para">
              <span class="first-word">Blockchain</span> technology is the
              concept or protocol behind the running of the blockchain.
              Blockchain technology makes
              <strong>cryptocurrencies</strong> (digital currencies secured by
              cryptography) like Bitcoin work just like the internet makes email
              possible. The blockchain is an immutable (unchangeable, meaning a
              transaction or file recorded cannot be changed) distributed
              <strong>digital ledger</strong> (digital record of transactions or
              data stored in multiple places on a computer network) with many
              use cases beyond cryptocurrencies. Immutable and distributed are
              two fundamental blockchain properties. The immutability of the
              ledger means you can always trust it to be accurate. Being
              distributed protects the blockchain from network attacks. Each
              transaction or record on the ledger is stored in a “block.” The
              information contained in a block is dependent on and linked to the
              information in a previous block and, over time, forms a chain of
              transactions. Hence the word <strong>blockchain</strong>.
              <!-- So , how should you use this web app , this is very easy , first of all
            you can read the topic but in order to give any comments ,see other
            people comments, ask any question or give more info about the topic ,
            you will need to create a account in here or logIn with google.
            So here are the steps to follow.
            <ul class="instruction-list">
              <strong>There are two methods to logIn First is "GoogleSignIn"</strong>

              <li class="steps">A popup will open-up click on "signIn with google" button at the bottom of pop-up</li>
              <strong>In this way you can easily logIn your account with google. The other method is "email/password".</strong>
              <li class="steps">For this first of all click on "SignUp" button in the navbar , give valid email & password</li>
              <li class="steps">After submission you will be successfully loggedIn</li>
              <li class="steps">And whenever you will need to signIn you can use this email/password by clicking on "SignIn" button , 
                enter email/password in the pop-up box & click on "Submit" button.</li>
