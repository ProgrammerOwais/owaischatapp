          <h2>Topic discussion chat app</h2>
          <p class="para">
            Hi there, my name is Muhammad Owais & I am a frontend developer. Today I
            wanna discuss about my chat app which I was working on for a while . I
            created this app for my class , the purpose of creating this app is to
            share a knowledge which I have or giving
            <strong>"Pro Topics / Articles"</strong>
            reference with a little bit information which I think is very necessary
            for a computer Science student. In the app , I will post a topic which
            will be related to current technology & will discuss why this is so much
            important & what will be the authentic/standard way to learn more about
            this.
            <img src="./journey.jpg" class="img3" alt="journey">
             
             There are a lot more to discuss but the purpose of this app is to
            make a IT students too informative so that he/she can know that where
            the technology is going & can decide which field of "IT" is very best
            for him/her. From time to time we will post different Topics related to
            IT. And one of the most important thing , you can ask any question
            related to topic or if you have already have a knowledge about given
            topic than you can share with us more in the comment section.

            <!-- should my chat app look & work. So , first of
            all I am trying to figure out what type of functionality should I

            requesting to my respectable fellow to give me honest feedback about my
            app that which feature of the app are awesome & which part of the app

            you can read the topic but in order to give any comments ,see other
            people comments, ask any question or give more info about the topic ,
            you will need to create a account in here or logIn with google.

            <ul class="instruction-list">
              <strong>There are two methods to logIn First is "GoogleSignIn"</strong>
